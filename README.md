# Insect Recognition Project

## Overview

This collaborative project, undertaken in partnership with Mondo Novo Electronics Srl, is dedicated to the intricate task of identifying and recognizing various insect species through low-resolution photographs captured by two 16-megapixel cameras. The challenge is compounded by the limited image definition and a relatively small dataset, making high recognition accuracy a primary objective despite these obstacles.

## Objectives

Our primary focus is on leveraging advanced Computer Vision algorithms, specifically employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Given the complexity of the problem, these algorithms are adept at extracting meaningful features from insect images, even in low-definition conditions.

## Methodology

1. **Data Augmentation:** We begin by augmenting the original dataset to enhance its variety and improve the model's generalization capabilities.

2. **CNN Development:** The subsequent step involves developing a convolutional neural network tailored to the unique challenges of insect recognition. CNNs are recognized for their effectiveness in processing visual data.

3. **Training Phase:** Following the model's development, we initiate the training process using the curated and augmented dataset. The ultimate goal is to achieve a highly accurate and reliable insect recognition model.

## Significance

This project marks a significant advancement in the application of Computer Vision technologies to address real challenges in the fields of agriculture and biology, with a specific emphasis on insect recognition. Our collective efforts aim to contribute to the development of innovative solutions for insect identification, holding potential implications for pest control and ecological studies.
